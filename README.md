Threat Hunting is time consuming enough as it is.  Coming up with and tracking metrics to justify your hunt team to the Execs often takes time away from your Threat Hunting.  I have created this Excel document to help automate as much of that as possible. The Strategic Overview tab is auto-updated based upon what you enter in the Threat Hunts Tab.  This is currently based on Mitre ATT&CK Tactics as it provides a high level overview appropriate for executives.
